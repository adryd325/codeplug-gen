# codeplug-gen

Make codeplug making a little less hellish

Takes CSV exports from this spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TSKUV0OB4ZxG7A5Md1KHd1Sa-ZHVHsSnnqS6IgjDdfY/

And converts them into formats suitable for radio programming

## Supported Radios/CPS

### OpenGD77

Outputs CSV for import of channels and contacts

### APX CPS

Outputs TSV for copy pasting into pre-made conventional personalities and zone channel assignments. It's a bit finnicky because different models and flashcodes have different columns available

TODO: Scanlists, Trunking and NAS

## I'd like to support the following, eventually

### Chirp (CSV)

Chirp supports a huge quantity of analog radios

### Mototrbo CPS (1 and 2) (TSV / Copy Paste)

### Harris RPM2 (CSV)

### Harris RPM1

Will need to reverse engineer their binary format for Sets

### Tetra CPS Plus (TSV / Copy Paste)

I think this one would just be funny
